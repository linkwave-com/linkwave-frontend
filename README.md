# 🌊 LinkWave — Crypto-Native Subscriptions Infrastructure

**LinkWave** is a developer-friendly platform for enabling **recurring crypto payments in USDC**.  
Designed for **SaaS platforms**, **startups**, **indie builders**, and **Web3 tools**, LinkWave makes it easy to add subscriptions with just a few lines of code — no banks, no friction.

## 🔗 Why LinkWave?

- Traditional payment systems don't work everywhere  
- Banks block transactions  
- Web3 users get left behind  
- Crypto is hard to integrate — especially for recurring billing

LinkWave encapsulates the complexity and gives you a clean, customizable interface to accept global subscriptions in USDC — via **Solana**, for now.

> 💬 Think: **Stripe for crypto subscriptions**, but lightweight, fast, and borderless.

> 💡 Whether you're building an AI tool, a newsletter, a VPN, or a browser plugin — LinkWave gives you the billing layer that just works.
